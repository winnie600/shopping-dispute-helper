Hi,
 
is
 
the
 
phone
 
still

Same

[2025-10-05

Seller:
 
Yes,
 
still
 
available.
 
Same
 
as
 
shown.
 
I’ve
 
kept
 
it
 
in
 
great
 
condition
 
—
 
only
 
a
 
tiny
 
scratch
 
on
 
the
 
lower
 
frame
 
(see

been
 
repaired
 
or

Can
 
you
 
lower
 
the
 
price
 
a
 
bit?
 
I’ve
 
seen
 
some
 
listed
 
around
 
9.0–9.2k.
 
[2025-10-05
 
12:19]
 
Seller:
 
I
 
listed
 
9.5
 
because
 
it’s
 
in
 
excellent
 
shape.
 
If
 
you
 
confirm
 
now,
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
9.2.
 
[2025-10-05

Okay,

works.

Buyer:
 
I
 
checked
 
and
 
found
 
the

has
 
been
 
**replaced**.
 
Apple
 
Support
 
shows
 
“Genuine

(see
 
attached
 
screenshot).
 
The
 
listing
 
and
 
chat
 
never
 
mentioned
 
this.
 
I’d
 
like
 
to
 
**return
 
the
 
item
 
for
 
a
 
refund**.
 
[2025-10-07

Seller:
 
The
 
screen
 
is
 
**genuine
 
Apple**,
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
service
 
record.
 
You
 
didn’t
 
ask,
 
so
 
I
 
didn’t
 
bring
 
it
 
up.
 
Works
 
perfectly
 
fine.

Buyer:
 
A

replacement
 
—
 
even

is
 
**material
 
information**
 
that
 
must
 
be
 
disclosed.
 
You
 
also
 
said
 
“no
