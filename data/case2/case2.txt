Buyer:
 
Hi!
 
Is
 
this
 
pair
 
still
 
available?
 
Looks
 
really
 
clean.
  
 
[2025-09-16

Seller:
 
Yes,
 
still
 
available.
 
Worn
 
twice
 
indoors,
 
soles
 
are
 
very
 
clean.
  
 
[2025-09-16

Buyer:
 
Is
 
the
 
sizing
 
true?
 
I
 
usually
 
wear
 
US9
 
for
 
other
 
Jordan
 
1s.
  
 
[2025-09-16
 
19:56]
 
Seller:
 
Yep,
 
true
 
US9.
 
I
 
wear
 
US9
 
too
 
and
 
it
 
fits
 
snugly.

Buyer:
 
I
 
just
 
tried
 
them
 
—
 
they
 
fit
 
**like
 
US8.5**,
 
not
 
US9.
 
You
 
listed
 
US9
 
but
 
it’s
 
too
 
tight.
 
I
 
think
 
it’s
 
**not
 
as
 
described**
 
and
 
want
 
a
 
return
 
+
 
refund.
  
 
[2025-09-19
 
10:10]
 
Seller:
 
That’s
 
strange.
 
I
 
also
 
wear
 
US9
 
and
 
they
 
fit
 
me
 
fine.
 
I
 
didn’t
 
modify
 
anything.
  
 
[2025-09-19
 
10:18]
 
Buyer:
 
But
 
they’re
 
definitely
 
tighter
 
than
 
my
 
other
 
pairs.
 
Can
 
I
 
send
 
them
 
back?

According
 
to
 
Nike
 
and
 
sneaker
 
community
 
sources,
 
the
 
**Air
 
Jordan
 
1
 
University
 
Blue**
 
runs
 
about
 
**0.5
 
size
 
smaller**
 
than
 
standard
 
Jordan
 
1s
 
—
 
many
 
buyers
 
report
 
the
 
same.
  
 
→
 
It
 
appears
 
**neither
 
party
 
is
 
at
 
fault**;
 
this
 
is

**product

Recommendation:
  
 
**A)**
 
Return
 
&
 
Full
 
Refund
 
(Buyer
 
covers
 
**NT$60
 
shipping**)
 
or
  
 
**B)**
 
Negotiate
 
a
 
**partial
 
refund
 
(~10%)**
 
if
 
Buyer
 
keeps
 
the
 
item.

Buyer:
 
Oh,
 
I
 
see.
 
I
 
didn’t
 
know
 
that.
 
Then
 
it’s
 
not
 
your
 
fault
 
either.
  
 
[2025-09-19

Seller:
 
Yeah,
 
I
 
had
 
no
 
idea
 
too.
 
I
 
can
 
refund
 
**NT$500**
 
as
 
goodwill
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
keep
 
them.
  
 
[2025-09-19

Buyer:
 
That’s
 
fair.
 
My
 
friend
 
can
 
wear
 
them
 
anyway.
 
Let’s
 
keep
 
it.
