Buyer:
 
Just
 
received
 
the
 
item
 
—
 
works
 
fine,
 
but
 
**no
 
USB-C
 
charging
 
cable**.
  
 
Listing
 
and
 
chat
 
didn’t
 
mention
 
it’s
 
missing,
 
so
 
I
 
assumed
 
it
 
came
 
with
 
everything.
  
 
I’d
 
like
 
to
 
**return
 
it
 
for
 
a
 
full
 
refund**.

Seller:
 
I
 
only
 
sold
 
what’s
 
in
 
the
 
photos.
 
I
 
used
 
the
 
cable
 
for
 
my
 
phone
 
so
 
didn’t
 
include
 
it
 
—
 
thought
 
everyone
 
has
 
one
 
anyway.
  
 
[2025-10-13

Buyer:
 
I
 
see,
 
but
 
the
 
original
 
box
 
usually
 
includes
 
one.

Okay,
 
if
 
that’s

I’ll
 
keep
 
it

how
